# Welcome to my website!

I am Lily (Shi-tao) Zhang who is trying to be a good bio-statistician. 

My interest in biology began after reading a biography of Jane Goodall, who sadly passed away this year. Her lifelong devotion to the study of chimpanzee behavior deeply inspired me and encouraged me to pursue a path in biology. 

After earning my PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, I came to the United States to continue my research and further develop myself. Over time, I realized that the wet lab was not where I wanted to make my contribution to improving the world. During my PhD project, I developed a strong interest in coding and statistics, which ultimately led me to pursue another degree in bio-statistics. 

On this website, you will find my published works, and also find news and updates on my current research projects. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about me. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:shitao.zhang@case.edu) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
